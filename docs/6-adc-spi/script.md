**NARRATOR**

This concludes the .NET IoT for Beginners series, at least for now. I had a lot of fun making it, and I hope you found it useful. I tried to include a good sampling of topics, and you should be able to to extend these lessons to apply to any of the dozens of IoT devices supported by the .NET IoT libraries. If I missed something that you'd also like to see covered in this series, please let me know in the comments. I'm also the author of the .NET IoT docs, so if you have any topics you want added to the docs, please open an issue on the dotnet docs repo.

Thanks for watching. Happy IoT hacking, and I hope to see you again soon!
