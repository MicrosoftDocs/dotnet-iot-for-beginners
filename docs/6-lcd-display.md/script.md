Narrator: In this video, we're going to show you how to use .NET and Raspberry Pi to use an LCD display.

Narrator: First, let's open up our .NET project and create a new class for the LCD display. We'll call it "LCDDisplay."

Narrator: In this class, we're going to import the necessary libraries for using the LCD display with Raspberry Pi. We'll need "System.Device.Gpio" and "System.Threading."

Narrator: Now, we're going to define the pins on the Raspberry Pi that will be used for the LCD display. We'll use pin 22 for the data and pin 18 for the clock.

Narrator: Next, we're going to initialize the LCD display with the defined pins and set the cursor to the top left position.

Narrator: Now, let's create a method for writing text to the LCD display. We'll call it "WriteText."

Narrator: In this method, we'll take in a string of text and send it to the LCD display to be displayed.

Narrator: Now, let's test out our LCD display class. In our main program, we'll create an instance of the LCDDisplay class and call the WriteText method.

Narrator: Let's compile and run the program to see if our text is displayed on the LCD.

Narrator: Great, it's working!

Narrator: Now, let's add some more functionality to our LCDDisplay class. We'll create a method for clearing the display and another for setting the cursor position.

Narrator: In the ClearDisplay method, we'll simply send the clear command to the LCD. For the SetCursorPosition method, we'll take in x and y coordinates and set the cursor to that position.

Narrator: Let's test out these new methods by writing some text, moving the cursor, and clearing the display.

Narrator: We'll compile and run the program again to see if the new methods work as expected.

Narrator: Great, everything is working as expected! Using .NET and Raspberry Pi, we can easily control an LCD display and add it to our projects.
