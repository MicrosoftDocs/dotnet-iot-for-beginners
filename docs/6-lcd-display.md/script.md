Narrator: In this video, we're going to show you how to use .NET and Raspberry Pi to use an LCD display.

Narrator: First, let's open up our .NET project and create a new class for the LCD display. We'll call it "LCDDisplay."

Narrator: In this class, we're going to import the necessary libraries for using the LCD display with Raspberry Pi. We'll need "System.Device.Gpio" and "System.Threading."

Narrator: Now, we're going to define the pins on the Raspberry Pi that will be used for the LCD display. We'll use pin 22 for the data and pin 18 for the clock.

Narrator: Next, we're going to initialize the LCD display with the defined pins and set the cursor to the top left position.

Assume the video is part of a series. A previous video much earlier in the series already showed the viewer how to build and deploy apps. Assume the viewer has already installed all the tools they need, like the .NET SDK. Assume the viewer knows how to create C# programs.

Narrator: Hey there, welcome back to our series on using .NET and Raspberry Pi. In this video, we're going to show you how to use a 20x4 LCD display with a built-in Pcf8574 GPIO expander.

Narrator: Before we get started, make sure you have the necessary tools and software installed. This includes the .NET SDK and the appropriate libraries for the LCD display.

[Camera shows the narrator typing on his computer]

Narrator: To start, we'll create a new C# program. In your project, add a reference to the library for the LCD display.

[Camera shows the narrator highlighting the library in the project references]

Narrator: Next, we'll import the necessary namespaces for the LCD display. In your program, add the following using statements:

[Camera shows the narrator typing the using statements on his screen]

Narrator: Now we're ready to start working with the LCD display. To initialize it, we'll create a new instance of the LCD class and pass in the appropriate parameters for the GPIO expander.

[Camera shows the narrator typing the code to create the LCD instance]

Narrator: Now that we've initialized the LCD display, we can start using it in our program. The first thing we'll do is clear the display to make sure it's ready for us to write on.

[Camera shows the narrator typing the code to clear the display]

Narrator: Next, we can set the cursor position on the display where we want to start writing our text. This is done using the SetCursorPosition method and passing in the row and column values.

[Camera shows the narrator typing the code to set the cursor position]

Narrator: Now we're ready to write some text on the display. We can do this using the Write method and passing in the string we want to display.

[Camera shows the narrator typing the code to write on the display]

Narrator: You can also change the text color and style on the display using the SetTextColor and SetTextStyle methods.

[Camera shows the narrator typing the code to change the text color and style]

Narrator: There are many other methods and properties available for the LCD class, so be sure to check out the documentation to see what else you can do with it.

Narrator: That's it for now. In the next video, we'll show you how to create a more advanced program using the LCD display and Raspberry Pi. Thanks for watching.n .NET.

Narrator: Now, let's create a method for writing text to the LCD display. We'll call it "WriteText."

Cut to narrator view of typing code in .NET.

Narrator: In this method, we'll take in a string of text and send it to the LCD display to be displayed.

Narrator: Now, let's test out our LCD display class. In our main program, we'll create an instance of the LCDDisplay class and call the WriteText method.

Cut to narrator view of typing code in .NET.

Narrator: Let's compile and run the program to see if our text is displayed on the LCD.

Narrator: Great, it's working!

Narrator: Now, let's add some more functionality to our LCDDisplay class. We'll create a method for clearing the display and another for setting the cursor position.

Cut to narrator view of typing code in .NET.

Narrator: In the ClearDisplay method, we'll simply send the clear command to the LCD. For the SetCursorPosition method, we'll take in x and y coordinates and set the cursor to that position.

Cut to narrator view of typing code in .NET.

Narrator: Let's test out these new methods by writing some text, moving the cursor, and clearing the display.

Cut to narrator view of typing code in .NET.

Narrator: We'll compile and run the program again to see if the new methods work as expected.

Narrator: Great, everything is working as expected! Using .NET and Raspberry Pi, we can easily control an LCD display and add it to our projects.
