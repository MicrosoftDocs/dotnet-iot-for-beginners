Hi there, welcome back to our series on using .NET and Raspberry Pi. In this video, we're going to be showing you how to use a MCP3008 analog-to-digital converter, or ADC, with your Raspberry Pi.

Before we get started, let's quickly explain what an ADC is and why you might want to use one. An ADC allows you to convert an analog signal, like the voltage coming from a potentiometer or temperature probe, into a digital signal that your Raspberry Pi can understand and use in a C# program.

So, let's get started. The first thing you'll need is a MCP3008 ADC chip, which you can easily find online or at your local electronics store. Next, you'll need to connect the chip to your Raspberry Pi using the SPI pins, as shown in the diagram on your screen.

Now, let's move over to Visual Studio and set up a new C# project. To access the ADC from your C# program, you'll need to install the "MCP3008.Net" NuGet package, which you can do by going to the "Manage NuGet Packages" window and searching for "MCP3008.Net". Once you've installed the package, you're ready to start using the ADC in your program.

Cut to Visual Studio.

In your C# program, you'll first need to import the "MCP3008.Net" namespace at the top of your code. Then, you'll need to create an instance of the "MCP3008" class and initialize it with the appropriate SPI channel and chip select pin number.

Once you have an instance of the "MCP3008" class, you can use its "ReadSingleEnded" method to read the analog value from a specific channel on the ADC. For example, if you have a potentiometer connected to channel 0 on the ADC, you can read its value like this:

int potentiometerValue = mcp3008.ReadSingleEnded(0);

Now, let's test this out on a breadboard. Cut to a close-up of the breadboard and potentiometer. As you can see, we have our MCP3008 ADC chip connected to the Raspberry Pi via the SPI pins, and our potentiometer is connected to channel 0 on the ADC.

To test the ADC, we'll create a simple C# program that reads the value of the potentiometer and displays it on the console. Cut to Visual Studio and show the code. Then, run the program and show the output on the console.

As you can see, the program is successfully reading the value of the potentiometer and printing it to the console. You can use this same approach to read values from other sensors, like an RTD temperature probe.

Cut to a close-up of the RTD temperature probe connected to the ADC. Then, show the code for a program that reads the temperature from the probe and displays it on the console. Run the program and show the output on the console.

And there you have it, using .NET and Raspberry Pi to read analog values from sensors using a MCP3008 ADC.
