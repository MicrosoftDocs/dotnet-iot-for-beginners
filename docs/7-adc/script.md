Hi there, and welcome back to our series on using .NET and Raspberry Pi. In this video, we're going to be talking about how to use the MCP3008 analog-to-digital controller, or ADC for short.

Now, if you're not familiar with what an ADC is, don't worry. It's a piece of hardware that allows you to convert analog signals, like the voltage coming from a potentiometer or temperature probe, into digital signals that your Raspberry Pi can understand and use in your programs.

To get started, let's first take a look at the MCP3008 ADC. [show the viewer a close-up of the MCP3008 ADC] As you can see, it has 8 input channels, which means it can read up to 8 different analog signals at once. It also has a few pins for power and communication.

Next, let's hook up our potentiometer to the ADC. [show the viewer a close-up of the potentiometer being connected to the ADC] We'll connect the potentiometer's ground pin to the ADC's ground pin, the wiper pin to one of the input channels, and the VCC pin to the ADC's VCC pin. This will allow us to read the analog signal coming from the potentiometer using the ADC.

Now that we have our potentiometer connected to the ADC, let's write a program to read the analog signal. [show the viewer the code for the program on screen]

First, we'll import the necessary libraries for using the ADC. Then, we'll create a new instance of the MCP3008 class, which will allow us to communicate with the ADC.

Next, we'll use the ReadSingleEnded method to read the analog signal from the input channel we connected our potentiometer to. This method returns a value between 0 and 1023, which represents the voltage of the input signal.

Finally, we'll print the value to the console so we can see it in action. [show the viewer the program running and printing the value to the console]

As you can see, the value changes as we turn the potentiometer knob, allowing us to control the analog signal with the ADC.

Now, let's quickly demonstrate how to use the ADC with a two-wire RTD probe. [show the viewer the RTD probe being connected to the ADC] We'll connect the RTD probe's signal and ground wires to the ADC's input channel and ground pin, respectively.

Then, we can use the same ReadSingleEnded method to read the analog signal from the RTD probe and convert it to a temperature value. [show the viewer the code for converting the analog signal to a temperature value]

And that's how you can use the MCP3008 ADC with .NET and Raspberry Pi. In our next video, we'll be discussing how to use the ADC with other types of sensors, so stay tuned!
