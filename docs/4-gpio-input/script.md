- Title: Learning GPIO Input with .NET Core
- Demonstrates using GPIO pins for input by detecting the opening and closing of a circuit
- Uses jumper wire to connect pin 21 to ground and writes code to detect circuit open/closed
- Creates an instance of the GpioController class, registers a callback for changes in pin value
- Shows examples of detecting button press, open doors using switches, reed switches and laser emitter/receiver
- Next video covers device bindings to communicate with temperature and humidity sensors
