Hi! I'm Cam Soper, a content developer working with .NET at Microsoft. One of my favorite things about is how .NET runs everywhere. Well, maybe not *everywhere*, but it does run on a wide variety of devices and operating systems.

In this series, I'm going to talk about using .NET on common single-board computers, like Raspberry Pi and Hummingboard. Since these devices are small and inexpensive, they're often used in Internet of Things scenarios. Since Raspberry Pi is fairly ubiquitous, I'll use Raspberry Pi for most of my examples.

First we'll look at how to deploy, run, and debug code in these environments.
