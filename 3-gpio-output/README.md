# General Purpose Input/Output: Use GPIO output to control devices with .NET

In this video, Microsoft Sr. Content Developer Cam Soper shows you how to use the pins on an single-board computer (like the Raspberry Pi) to control external devices. Starting with the basics of the General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) header, Cam demonstrates how to use a breadboard and a GPIO Breakout Board to create a simple LED circuit. Then, using .NET 7 and the .NET IoT Libraries, Cam shows you how to control the LED using a while loop and GPIO pin 18. Finally, he takes it up a notch by demonstrating how to use a relay to control a larger device like a light bulb or a fan. Join Cam as he walks you through this IoT equivalent of "Hello, World!"
