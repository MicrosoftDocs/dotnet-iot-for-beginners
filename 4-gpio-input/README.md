# General Purpose Input/Output: Read input with GPIO and .NET

Join Microsoft Sr. Content Developer Cam Soper as he continues his exploration of using his Raspberry Pi's General-Purpose Input/Output header in this video. This time, Cam shows you how to use the same pins for input, starting with a demonstration of how to detect open and closed circuits using a magnetic reed switch. He then moves on to a laser setup, where he uses a voltage divider to detect when the laser beam is broken. Cam finishes the video by accepting a challenge from his son: to send and receive Morse code messages using laser light! Join Cam on this IoT adventure and learn how to create practical applications using single-board computers!
