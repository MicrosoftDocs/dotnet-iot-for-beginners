# Deploy .NET apps to Single Board Computers and Debug Remotely

Microsoft Senior Content Developer Cam Soper shows how to deploy, run, and debug .NET code on ARM-based single-board-computers (such as Raspberry Pi, Orange Pi, ODROID, and others). The video covers the self-contained deployment process and how to copy the published files to the device. Finally, the narrator explains how to remotely debug the app on the device using Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code.
